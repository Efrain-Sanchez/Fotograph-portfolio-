# Fotograph-portfolio-
Personal project ; personal-portfolio website  
This is the idea. Create a personal website to show a photographer's work.
First part of this projest consists on developing the interface (responsive) of the site
The real challege for me would be the *shearch bar* Since we are working with photos, I'm looking 
to make it work by filtring by: Predominant colors, places and/or category. 
Now, 16/05/2020. I don't really know how I will achieve it. Im using HTML5, CSS3 (SASS), JS.
